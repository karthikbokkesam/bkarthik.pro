Well it took me around 4 years to setup my portfolio website. Finally today is the day that it was ment to happen I guess.
``` Yes I'm judging myself too at this very moment, seriously 4 years? ```. The main reason for the delay would be that
I could never make up my mind on what I wanted or how I wanted my portfolio website to look like. I went back and forth 
on choosing the right tech stack between
 - Hugo
 - Astro
 - Gatsby
 - React
 - NextJs
 - Wordpress

The above sentences could very well be be some of the reasons I could never get this done till now but I would be lying to myself.
The harsh reality is that, it was never about the difficulty of choosing the right tech stack or not having the skills to execute the task.

I can definitly give the credit to me not being able to convince myself that I can do it, because it was quite easy to give up when I could justify that the task was too difficult,
I didn't have the skills to do it, maybe the tech stack isn't right or I don't like the design of the website.

So there are a few things I'd like to share from the past 4 years of experience that helped me realise how to get things done.

### Eat the frog 

#### The Eat the Frog productivity technique is a straight forward approach to managing your tasks

- ***Identify Your Most Critical Task*** : Determine the most important task you need to accomplish for the day.
- ***Do the Most Challenging Task First*** : Tackle the most difficult task right away, preferably in the morning.
- ***Focus on One Thing at a Time*** : Avoid multitasking and give your full attention to the chosen task.
- ***Break Big Tasks into Smaller Steps*** : Divide large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- ***Set Goals and Deadlines*** : Define clear objectives and allocate time limits for each task.
- ***Avoid Distractions*** : Minimize interruptions and stay focused on your priority task.
- ***Review Your Progress at the End of the Day*** : Reflect on what you've accomplished and adjust as needed.

PS : don't forget to take enough breaks in between 

### It doesn't have to be perfect

The overwhelming pressure that things need to turn out perfect is also a reason I used to quit most of the things that I started.

***Well guess what? I've got news for you***

##### turns out things don't need to be perfect from the get go

The whole point of learnig is to do stuff iteratively and get better at it. If you are anything like me trust me no matter how bad you think it is ***ship it***.
You'll be much more motivated, productive and stress free once you ***let it fly***. 
Keep building upon the foundation you laid down, you get to learn a lot more doing it this way.

### Copy shamelessly and learn from it

Again most of what we call learning is just copying what someone else had thought off or done before, so don't feel guilty to copy stuff you don't know.
___But the important part is that you should be able to analyse the things you copy and learn from it by modifying and exploring it.___ 

Untill this mornig as I started setting up the website and blog I had no idea that mark down was supported in nextJs. I was browsing through the nextJs templates and 
copied a portfolio template that I liked made by [Chronark](https://chronark.com/). The plan is to undestand what exists and build on top of it. I've already made quite a 
few updates to the code base. Learnt about
- [Rome and Biome](https://biomejs.dev/blog/annoucing-biome/) this is a good read. Apparently its time to move on from prettier.
- [Markdown in nextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)
- *Deployment with [vercel](https://vercel.com)* this site is hosted on vercel.
- [remote caching with turbo repo](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching#enable-and-disable-remote-caching-for-your-team) aslo a good read, if you are interested in 
better build time for your nextJs projects.

***Thanks for sticking around till the end, let's break the slump and get things done***. I've got a lot of stuff planned to put up on the website and blog in the coming months,
stay tuned and **may the force be with you**. Cheers to a weekend spent well üçª
